Cyberpunk deckbuilding strategy game

I'm going for less _Slay the Spire_ vibes, and more along the lines of _Mystic Vale_ crossed with _Race the Galaxy_, mixed with _Star Realms_ and plenty of cyberpunk themes.

Very, very early development

To run in its current state you will need to download the free and open source [Godot](https://godotengine.org/download/linux) editor. You can run the editor and then "Import" the project.godot file from the root of this repot. F5 to play!
