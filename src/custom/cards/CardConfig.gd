# This dictionary defines how much more a text field is allowed
# to expand their rect in order to fit its text before shrinking it.
#
# The defaults of 1 means the text will shrink until it all fits within
# the defined rect of the label.
#
# This is useful for things like card names, where it's preferable to expand
# The title rect, instead of reducing the name's font size too much.
#
# You have to be careful with this field, as allowing too much expansion will
# lead to cards with a lot of text, having it overflow their boundaries
